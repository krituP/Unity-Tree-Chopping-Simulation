# Unity-Tree-Chopping-Simulation
Unity Physics Tree Chopping Simulation 


Implemented a physically accurate tree chopping simulation. In this simulation, a character will control an axe which they swing at the tree. The novel work done in this project is the physics
interaction between the tree and the axe in addition to control of the character. When the axe intersects with the tree, it will cut a part of the tree away. The tree will fall down once enough of
the tree has been cut.


Added project file and report.
